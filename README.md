# Messenger-Client
JavaFX - builded client app without styling
Works with my Messenger-Server app, to connect each other you should specify 
ip-adress in Main class to your outer ip of your server.
Later I planing add authorisation, properties file to save ip and other settings, encryption, styling and others
I guess, enchancing client app would bring enchancing server app
